synopsis: "Plugin for protoc protobuf compiler to generate ocaml definitions from a .proto file"

description: """ The plugin generates ocaml type definitions,
serialization and deserialization functions from a protobuf file.
The types generated aims to create ocaml idiomatic types;
- messages are mapped into modules
- oneof constructs are mapped to polymorphic variants
- enums are mapped to adt's
- map types are mapped to assoc lists
- all integer types are mapped to int by default (exact mapping is also possible)
- all floating point types are mapped to float.
- packages are mapped to nested modules
