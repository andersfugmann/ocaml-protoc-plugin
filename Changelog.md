## 6.0.0: 2014-04-13

### New features
- [x] Implement json serialization and deserialization (#5)
- [x] Support special json mapping for google types (#9)
- [x] Add deprecation annotations for deprecated fields, services etc (#8)
- [x] Add option to prefix generated files with their package name
- [x] Copy documentation from proto files into generated ocaml bindings

### Bug fixes
- [x] Fix file output name if files contains a '-'
- [x] Resolve bug for Request/Response module aliases leading to
generating uncompilable code. (#21)
- [x] Fix codegen bug for messages with out fields and setting
singleton_records = true (#20)
- [x] In Services, the package field is now correctly set to None if
      the service if not defined in a package scope (#24)

### Misc changes
- [x] Unify serialization and deserialization spec and optimize oneof
      handling
- [x] Simplify types used in code generation to improve readaility
- [x] *Replace `val name': unit -> string` with `val name: unit ->
string` which will only return the full protobuf name
- [x] Optimize merge functions by applying eager evaluation
- [x] Change signature of `to_proto'` to return unit and not a writer

(`*` indicates breaking change)

### Notes
  `Message.name': unit -> string` has been renamed to `Message.name:
  unit -> string`, and is now contains the fully qualified protobuf
  message name. Before the name was the ocaml module name of the
  message.

  `Service.Message` signature has been deprecated and replaced with
  `Spec.Message` signature. `Service.Message` is now an alias for
  `Spec.Message` and will be removed in future releases.

## 5.0.0: 2024-02-24

      speed improvments and is now on par with ocaml-protoc.
- [x] Improve handling of extensions and remove unused extensions
      argument for messages that do not carry extensions (Breaking change)
- [x] Add benchmarks based on bechamel for optimization and comparing
      performance against ocaml-protoc

      for serivce records (thanks @crackcomm)

## 4.0.0: 2020-05-10
- [x] Move userdefined opens to beginning of autogenerated files, to
      allow using new google types
- [*] Wrap google types (protofiles using googles well known types
      will need to add `open=Google_types` to the list of compilation options

## 3.0.0: 2020-01-06
